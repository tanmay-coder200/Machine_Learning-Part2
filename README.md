🤖 Machine Learning - Part 2: Supervised Learning & Classification 🚀
Welcome to the second leg of my Machine Learning journey! This repository focuses on the core pillars of Supervised Learning, moving beyond simple regression to master classification and complex decision-making models.

🛠️ What's Inside?
This module covers advanced algorithms used to categorize data and make predictions based on labeled datasets.

🌲 Ensemble Methods: Implementing Random Forests and Decision Trees for robust predictions.

⚔️ Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finding the optimal hyperplane for complex data separation.

📍 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classification based on proximity and similarity.

📊 Model Evaluation: Mastering metrics like Confusion Matrices, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to prove model performance.

💻 Tech Stack
Language: Python 🐍

Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📈 Key Learning
The focus here was transition from "Does this trend up?" to "Which category does this belong to?" with high precision.
